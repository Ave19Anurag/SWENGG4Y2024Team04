### 1. Introduction
Eco-Cycle is an online platform dedicated to fostering sustainability by enabling the exchange of recycled materials between manufacturers and recyclers. This document outlines the technical design, including system architecture, database schema, user interfaces, API specifications, and security measures.

### 2. System Overview
Eco-Cycle serves as a marketplace where manufacturers can discover and purchase recycled materials from recyclers. Core functionalities encompass user management, material listings, transaction processing, communication, and analytics.

### 3. Architecture Design

#### 3.1 Overview
The platform employs a microservices architecture, with each service handling specific tasks and communicating via RESTful APIs. The system leverages cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and reliability.

#### 3.2 Components
- **User Service:** Manages user registration, authentication, and profiles.
- **Listing Service:** Handles material listing creation, search, and management.
- **Transaction Service:** Manages the lifecycle of transactions, including orders and tracking.
- **Communication Service:** Supports messaging and notifications.
- **Analytics Service:** Generates reports and provides insights on user activities.

#### 3.3 Data Flow
1. Users register and authenticate through the User Service.
2. Recyclers post material listings via the Listing Service.
3. Manufacturers search listings and initiate transactions via the Transaction Service.
4. Users communicate through the Communication Service for inquiries and negotiations.
5. The Analytics Service aggregates and analyzes data for reporting.

### 4. Database Design

#### 4.1 Schema
- **Users Table:** Contains user information (ID, name, email, password hash, role).
- **Listings Table:** Contains details about material listings (ID, recycler ID, material type, quantity, price, location, quality certifications).
- **Transactions Table:** Records transaction details (ID, buyer ID, seller ID, listing ID, quantity, price, status).
- **Messages Table:** Stores communication records (ID, sender ID, receiver ID, message content, timestamp).
- **Analytics Table:** Stores aggregated data for reporting.

### 5. User Interface Design

#### 5.1 Web Interface
- **Homepage:** Features user registration/login, featured listings, and a search bar.
- **Dashboard:** Displays user profiles, active listings, transaction history, and messages.
- **Listing Page:** Shows detailed material listings with images, descriptions, and seller ratings.
- **Transaction Page:** Includes order status, shipment tracking, and feedback options.
- **Messaging Page:** Contains an inbox and conversation threads.

#### 5.2 Mobile Interface
- **Homepage:** Simplified navigation for registration/login and featured listings.
- **Dashboard:** Optimized user profile, active listings, transaction history, and messages.
- **Listing Page:** Mobile-friendly material listing details.
- **Transaction Page:** Mobile view for order status and tracking.
- **Messaging Page:** Chat-like interface for conversations.

### 6. API Design
- **User API:** Endpoints for registration, login, and profile management.
- **Listing API:** Endpoints for creating, updating, searching, and viewing listings.
- **Transaction API:** Endpoints for initiating, updating, and tracking transactions.
- **Communication API:** Endpoints for sending and receiving messages.
- **Analytics API:** Endpoints for retrieving user activity reports.

### 7. Security Design
- **Encryption:** SSL/TLS for data in transit, AES for data at rest.
- **Authentication:** JWT for secure user sessions.
- **Authorization:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Optional 2FA for enhanced security.

### 8. Performance Design
- **Scalability:** Utilization of cloud services (AWS, Azure) for auto-scaling.
- **Load Balancing:** Distribution of traffic across multiple servers.
- **Caching:** Implementation of caching strategies to minimize database load and enhance response times.

### 9. Deployment Design
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Automated testing and deployment using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- **Containerization:** Deployment using Docker for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Monitoring:** Use of Prometheus and Grafana for system performance monitoring and alerting.
