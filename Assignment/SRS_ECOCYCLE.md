### 1. Introduction
Eco-Cycle is an online platform developed to connect manufacturers and recyclers for the efficient exchange of recycled materials. It aims to streamline the process of sourcing and selling recycled materials, promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility in manufacturing processes. The platform provides a centralized marketplace where manufacturers can find suitable recycled materials and recyclers can showcase their available inventory.

### 2. Scope
Eco-Cycle will provide the following key functionalities:
- User registration and authentication
- Listings of available recycled materials
- Search and filter capabilities for materials
- Transaction management (buying and selling)
- Communication channels between manufacturers and recyclers
- Reporting and analytics for user activities

### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 User Management
- **Registration:** Users can register as either manufacturers or recyclers by providing necessary details such as name, email, password, and company information.
- **Authentication:** Secure login process for registered users with email verification and password encryption.
- **Profile Management:** Users can update their profiles, including contact information, company details, and preferences.

#### 3.2 Material Listings
- **Create Listings:** Recyclers can create detailed listings for recycled materials they have available for sale, including material type, quantity, price, location, and quality certifications.
- **Search and Filter:** Manufacturers can search and filter materials based on various criteria such as material type, quantity, price range, location, and quality standards.
- **View Listings:** Manufacturers can view detailed information about available recycled materials, including images, descriptions, and seller ratings.

#### 3.3 Transaction Management
- **Buying:** Manufacturers can initiate purchase requests for desired recycled materials directly from the platform, specifying quantity, delivery preferences, and payment terms.
- **Selling:** Recyclers receive purchase requests and can accept, negotiate, or decline based on availability and pricing. Once agreed, recyclers can finalize transactions, update inventory, and arrange for delivery.
- **Order Management:** Both manufacturers and recyclers can track the status of orders from initiation to completion, including order history, shipment tracking, and delivery confirmation.

#### 3.4 Communication
- **Messaging:** Built-in messaging system for direct communication between manufacturers and recyclers regarding specific listings, purchase inquiries, negotiation, and order fulfillment.
- **Notifications:** Email notifications for important updates such as new listings, purchase requests, order status changes, and messages received.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.1 Performance
- **Response Time:** System should respond to user actions within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Scalability:** The platform should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and listings without significant performance degradation, utilizing scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

#### 4.2 Security
- **Data Encryption:** User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
- **Access Control:** Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.

#### 4.3 Usability
- **Intuitive Interface:** User interface should be designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use, with intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action buttons.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure accessibility standards compliance (such as WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.

### 5. System Architecture
Eco-Cycle will be built using a microservices architecture, with separate services handling user management, material listings, transactions, communication, and analytics. The system will utilize cloud-based infrastructure (such as AWS or Azure) for scalability, reliability, and cost-effectiveness.

### 6. User Interface
The user interface will consist of web and mobile applications, providing a consistent experience across different devices and screen sizes. The interface will be designed using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) and mobile app development frameworks (React Native, Flutter) to ensure cross-platform compatibility and optimal performance.

### 7. Data Requirements
#### 7.1 User Data
- User profiles (name, email, password, role, contact information)
- Transaction history (purchase requests, orders, payments)
- Messaging history (sent and received messages between users)

#### 7.2 Material Data
- Material listings (type, quantity, price, location, quality certifications)
- Transaction records (purchase requests, orders, delivery status)

### 8. Security
Eco-Cycle will implement industry-standard security measures including:
- Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption for data transmission over the internet.
- Hashing and salting of passwords to protect user credentials from unauthorized access.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.

### 9. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumption: Users will have access to internet-enabled devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers) to access the Eco-Cycle platform.
- Dependency: Integration with third-party services for payment processing (such as Stripe or PayPal) to facilitate secure online transactions.

### 10. Appendices
Include any additional documentation, diagrams, or resources related to the project, such as:
- Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams for database schema design.
- Use case diagrams and sequence diagrams illustrating system interactions.
- Wireframes or mockups of user interface designs for web and mobile applications.
