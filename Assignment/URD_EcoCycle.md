### 1. Introduction
Eco-Cycle is an online platform aimed at facilitating the exchange of recycled materials between manufacturers and recyclers. This document outlines the user requirements for the Eco-Cycle platform.

### 2. User Profiles
Eco-Cycle will have two main user profiles:
- **Manufacturers:** Companies or individuals involved in manufacturing processes. They are interested in sourcing recycled materials for their production needs.
- **Recyclers:** Entities engaged in the collection and processing of recyclable materials. They seek to sell their recycled materials to manufacturers.

### 3. Functional Requirements
#### 3.1 Registration and Authentication
- **Requirement 1:** Users should be able to register for an account on Eco-Cycle, providing necessary information such as name, email, password, and company details (for manufacturers).
- **Requirement 2:** Registered users must be able to securely log in to the platform using their email and password.
- **Requirement 3:** Email verification should be implemented to ensure the validity of user accounts.

#### 3.2 Material Listings
- **Requirement 4:** Recyclers should be able to create detailed listings for recycled materials they have available for sale, including type, quantity, price, location, and quality certifications.
- **Requirement 5:** Manufacturers should be able to search and filter material listings based on various criteria such as material type, quantity, price range, location, and quality standards.
- **Requirement 6:** Manufacturers should be able to view detailed information about available recycled materials, including images, descriptions, and seller ratings.
- **Requirement 7:** Users should have the ability to bookmark or save favorite listings for future reference.

#### 3.3 Transaction Management
- **Requirement 8:** Manufacturers should be able to initiate purchase requests for desired recycled materials, specifying quantity, delivery preferences, and payment terms.
- **Requirement 9:** Recyclers should receive purchase requests and be able to accept, negotiate, or decline based on availability and pricing.
- **Requirement 10:** Once agreed, recyclers should be able to finalize transactions, update inventory, and arrange for delivery.
- **Requirement 11:** Both manufacturers and recyclers should be able to track the status of orders from initiation to completion, including order history, shipment tracking, and delivery confirmation.
- **Requirement 12:** Users should have the option to leave feedback or ratings for completed transactions.

#### 3.4 Communication
- **Requirement 13:** Eco-Cycle should provide a built-in messaging system for direct communication between manufacturers and recyclers regarding specific listings, purchase inquiries, negotiation, and order fulfillment.
- **Requirement 14:** Users should receive email notifications for important updates such as new listings, purchase requests, order status changes, and messages received.
- **Requirement 15:** Users should have the option to set communication preferences, such as email frequency and notification settings.

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
#### 4.1 Performance
- **Requirement 16:** The platform should respond to user actions within 2 seconds to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Requirement 17:** Eco-Cycle should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users and listings without significant performance degradation, utilizing scalable cloud-based infrastructure.

#### 4.2 Security
- **Requirement 18:** User data should be encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect sensitive information from unauthorized access or interception.
- **Requirement 19:** Role-based access control (RBAC) should be implemented to restrict access to sensitive functionalities and data based on user roles and permissions.
- **Requirement 20:** The platform should support multi-factor authentication for added security.

#### 4.3 Usability
- **Requirement 21:** The user interface should be designed with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and ease of use, with intuitive navigation and clear call-to-action buttons.
- **Requirement 22:** Eco-Cycle should comply with accessibility standards (such as WCAG) to accommodate users with disabilities, including support for screen readers and keyboard navigation.
- **Requirement 23:** The platform should be responsive and optimized for various devices and screen sizes.

### 5. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Assumption 1: Users will have access to internet-enabled devices (such as smartphones, tablets, or computers) to access the Eco-Cycle platform.
- Dependency 1: Integration with third-party services for payment processing (such as Stripe or PayPal) to facilitate secure online transactions.
